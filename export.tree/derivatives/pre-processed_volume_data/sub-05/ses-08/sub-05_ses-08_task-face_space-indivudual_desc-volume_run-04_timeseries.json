    "Description": "Head motion parameters obtained through fMRI data preprocessing.In fMRI data processing and analysis, head motion is a critical factor as it can affect data quality. To correct for motion artifacts, six motion parameters are typically recorded and adjusted. These parameters can be categorized into two types: translational and rotational.\n\n**Translational Parameters:**\n\n1. **X Translation (Translational X)**: Movement along the X-axis, usually representing left-right motion.\n2. **Y Translation (Translational Y)**: Movement along the Y-axis, usually representing anterior-posterior motion.\n3. **Z Translation (Translational Z)**: Movement along the Z-axis, usually representing superior-inferior motion.\n\n**Rotational Parameters:**\n\n1. **X Rotation (Rotational X)**: Rotation around the X-axis, usually representing head nodding motion.\n2. **Y Rotation (Rotational Y)**: Rotation around the Y-axis, usually representing head shaking motion.\n3. **Z Rotation (Rotational Z)**: Rotation around the Z-axis, usually representing head tilting motion."
