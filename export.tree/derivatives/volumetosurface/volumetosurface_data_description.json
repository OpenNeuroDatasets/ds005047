    "Description": "We used pre-processing based on surface to re-analyze the functional data following the completion of co-registration for the anatomical data. This two-stage method was adopted due to the necessity of volume-based pre-processing to produce undistorted functional volumes of high quality, which is essential for registering the functional data with the anatomical data. Surface-based pre-processing can only begin after obtaining this registration. During pre-processing based on surface, the processes are identical to those of volume-based pre-processing, with the only difference being that the ultimate spatial interpolation is conducted at the vertices of the intermediate gray matter surfaces. Therefore, the sole distinction lies in whether the data is being prepared on an irregular manifold of densely spaced vertices (surface) or a regular three-dimensional grid (volume). The procedures of surface-based pre-processing can finally be simplified to one spatial resampling (for addressing EPI distortion, head motion, and registration to anatomy) and one temporal resampling (for managing slice acquisition times). The advantage of conducting only two simple pre-processing steps is to avoid unnecessary interpolation and maximize the preservation of spatial resolution. The time-series data were ultimately generated for every vertex of the cortical surfaces after completing this pre-processing stage. The pre-processed surface-based data were stored in a file named “volumetosurface/sub-<subID>/ses-<sesID>/sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_run-<index>_hemi-lh/rh.surfacedata.gii” for each run. "
