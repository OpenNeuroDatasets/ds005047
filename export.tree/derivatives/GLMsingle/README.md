 <R2> is model accuracy expressed in terms of R^2 (percentage).

 <R2run> is R2 separated by run

 <HRFindex> is the 1-index of the best HRF

 <HRFindexrun> is HRFindex separated by run

<FRACvalue> is the fractional ridge regression regularization level chosen for each voxel

<betas_FITHRF_GLMDENOISE_RR> is the full set of single-trial beta weights. The intended purpose of betas are to characterize the relationship between perceived stimuli and brain responses. This relationship can be studied with neural encoding and neural decoding
in fMRI. The goal of neural encoding is to predict brain responses to perceived stimuli. Conversely, the goal of neural decoding is to classify,identify or reconstruct perceived stimuli from brain responses.
