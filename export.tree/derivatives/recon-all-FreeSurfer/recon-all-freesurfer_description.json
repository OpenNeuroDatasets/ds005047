    "Description": "We adopted the data analysis method proposed by Kay et al(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). The FreeSurfer software was utilized to generate participants’ pial and white surfaces based on the T1 volume. Furthermore, for each participant, we constructed an intermediate gray matter surface between the pial and the white surfaces. The results of reconstructing the cortical surface were saved as “recon-all-FreeSurfer/sub-<subID>” folders"
